# _Epicodus Resort Website_

### _Practicing more HTML from first lesson for a dummy page, with added branched CSS stylesheets to familiarize ourselves with GitHub and terminal, too_

### _and did so by making branches off the master after HTML bases were all done, only playing with the single .css file afterwards.

#### _**Pairing Kyle P. & David N.**_

## Setup

* _Not so much here besides:_
* _pointing terminal at folder,_
* _"git branch" line to bring up branches,_
* _"git checkout [branch]" to swap to that version of the stylesheet._
